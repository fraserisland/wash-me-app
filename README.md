1. Summary

  Washing clothes can be quiet difficult sometimes, especially when you're travelling, have a broken washing machine, don’t even have one, or simply, just too busy… This is a problem I personally, and many others have faced,  this is what provoked the creation of Wash-Me:

  A two-sided marketplace consisting of washers(users who will wash clothes), and wash-me's(users that need a washer).  Wash-me connects both the washers, and wash-me's - washers can advertise that their willing to wash clothes at a rate of their choice, and wash-me's can easily connect, and find those washers.

  Here's a brief on how it works. Wash-me's can enter a location of their choice, for example, it may be where they live, or somewhere they're travelling in the near future. The application will generate an interactive map which shows all the nearby Washers. These Washers are rated, can advertise extras, pickup, deliver, wash at your house, and more… It is all up to the Wash-me's/Washers. Nonetheless at the end of each day, whoever wants their clothes washed, will have them washed.
